# DCS-WORLD-EVENTS By BS MYTH

DCS World Events by BS Myth. This script will add dynamic world events to your mission. These events can be accessed through the radio menu item World Event. They can be triggered manually by users with access to the radio item or they can be set to randomly spawn. Only one event can be active at a time and events will have a timer. The world event has its own state management and doenst rely on any external scripts, just plug the script into your mission and go.
